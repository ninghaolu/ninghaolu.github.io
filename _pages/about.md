**Ninghao (Alex) Lu** is an undergraduate student in **Computer Science** at **NYU Shanghai, China**.

His research interests focus on computer vision and machine learning, with current research involving representation learning for LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models and improvements to discrete diffusion processes for better language models. More broadly, he is curious about how models perceive, represent, and generalize knowledge in ways that are efficient, effective and adaptable across different modalities and domains.

He is open to collaboration and is actively exploring a broader range of topics, aiming to develop a clearer long-term research direction.
